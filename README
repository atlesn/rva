==================================================================

This program continously reads from an RTSP stream and saves video
into files on disk.

To change the URL for the RTSP server or the output file name,
edit the source file `rva.c`.

Output file names will be appended with an -nnnn suffix where
nnnn is an index starting with zero when the program first
starts up. Whenever the program receives SIGUSR1 signal, the
file will be closed and saving will commence at the next index.
The index will wrap after 0255 and begin at zero. Existing
files will be deleted.

If the program receives SIGINT, the currently open file will be
finalized and closed before the program quits. If two SIGINTs
are received, the program will quit immediately.
